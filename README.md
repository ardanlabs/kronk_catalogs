# Kronk Catalogs

This project contains a model catalog for the [Kronk](https://github.com/ardanlabs/kronk) project. Please provide a PR to update and add models to the catalog.

### What's Kronk?

Kronk lets you use Go for hardware accelerated local inference with llama.cpp directly integrated into your applications via the [yzma](https://github.com/hybridgroup/yzma) module. Kronk provides a high-level API that feels similar to using an OpenAI compatible API.

This project also provides a model server for chat completions and embeddings. The server is compatible with the OpebWebUI project.
